# Neural Network Charity Analysis

## Purpose 
A hypothetical nonprofit foundation, Alphabet Soup, needs help analyzing the impact of their donations and vetting potential recipients by predicting which organizations are worth donating to and which are too high risk. I designed a deep learning neural network that evaluates all types of input data and produces a clear decision making result using the Python TensorFlow library.

### Results
